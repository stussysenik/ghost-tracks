use internet to search the relevant content, for now for the AI-based callings let's use the internal Claude let's say Sonnet or even Opus if you need (but make this a WIP so in the future you could easily swap it out, to still have the functionality) read and study all around it and really go into detail/token by token everything counts! in the end use chrome-devtools and playwright to first the idea systematically + then interactively using the chrome-devtools MCP. study the problem, I've done lots of research for you and most importantly execute this to the absolute attention-to-detail, consistency and give me a one-shot (don't optimize for this) take your time, think step by step, think in terms of interaction design, communication design and also marketing from the end user in mind, POV of the runner and the POV of the user of the site and build this thing. my final review will be on Vercel, use stacked gits to commit features, make sure there's a clear retraceable progression of ideas, comment the code - write for performance but for humans with reading comments and most importantly make sure to create the git and connect it to the Vercel deployment or wherever we're doing it (that's my assumption I didn't fully read everything but yes i trust you fully with the idea. I want to just open the fully working site with prompts - try it with text input, try it with like nearest similar visual route if it's not available for the selected segment, you can select a segment and it will give you ideas of what you could run - but always and state it directly you're not constraining creativity these are meant to be suggestions, when it comes to strava art the sky's the limit! but yes give me the working tool that would handle heavy-traffic and build this hype-tool in mind: this could be insanely popular thus really intentional system-engineering is necessary! i have the playwright CLI and chrome-devtools MCP installed already for you.
